# ðŸ¤– Web Scraper

The application uses `crawlee`to handle the heavy-lifting of scraping websites. You can visit the docs at [Crawlee Docs](https://crawlee.dev/). After `cloning` the repo, you need to run the following command from the terminal in root directory of the project to install the dependencies for the Web Scraper.

```
# installs all dependencies
npm i (recommended)

# or
pnpm i

# yarn
```

After all the dependencies are installed you can start the scraper with.

```
# start the development server
npm run start

# or
pnpm run start

# yarn start
```

Then entry point for the application is in the `main.ts` file.
